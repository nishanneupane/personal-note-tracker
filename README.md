<h1>**This Project is made using c++ programming**</h1><br/>
We use console based programming for that so it not very GUI friendly.

to run this program you can clone this repo and run the main file <h1>**note-tracker.cpp**</h1>
<br/>
there are some of the header files from which you can seperate some header files and constants.
